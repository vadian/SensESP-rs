# SensESP-rs

Sensor library in Rust designed for use with SignalK and the Sailor Hat ESP32.  Built with heavy inspiration from SensESP.
While this library will strive to eventually reach feature parity with the C++ SensESP implementation, it will not necessarily
follow the same patterns.

## Getting Started
Lots of starter information can be found in [The Rust on ESP Book](https://docs.esp-rs.org/book/)

Build all targets:
`cargo build`

Run the example on an ESP32: `cargo run --bin example`

### Setup

### Run
`cargo run`
